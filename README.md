Overview
The minitalk project at 42 is about creating a simple client-server communication program using UNIX signals. The goal is to send messages from a client to a server, character by character, using SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.

# Key Features 🔄📡
- Implements inter-process communication (IPC) using signals.

- Converts characters into binary signals for transmission.

- Handles variable-length messages reliably.

# Challenges & Learning 🧠👨‍💻
- Signal handling: Understanding and managing SIGUSR1 & SIGUSR2.

- Bitwise operations: Converting characters to binary for transmission.

- Asynchronous communication: Handling messages without data loss.

# Why This Project? 💡
A great way to explore low-level communication, improve system programming skills, and dive into the UNIX signal API!
